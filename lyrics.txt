(alright, click me, click me)
(alright, click me here)
(alright, click me, click me here)
(click on me, click me, click me here)

I love my computer
You make me feel alright
Every waking hour
And every lonely night

I love my computer
For all you give to me
Predictable errors
And no identity

And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy

All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
And we'll never ruin each other's day
'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away

(alright, click me, click me here)
(alright, click me, click me here)

I love my computer
You're always in the mood
I get so turned on
When I turn on you

I love my computer
You never ask for more
You can be a princess
Or you can be my whore

And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy

All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined in the most soulless way
And we'll never ruin each other's day
'Cause when I'm through I just click and you just go away

(alright, click me, click me here)
You just go away

The world outside is so big
But it's safe in my domain
'cause to you I'm just a number
And a clever screen name

All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be together for eternity
And no one's ever gonna take my love from me
'Cause I've got security, her password and a key

(alright, click me, click me here)

Go away (alright, click me, click me here)

Go away (click on me, click me, click me here)

Go away (click on me, alright, click me here)

Go away (click on me, click me, click me here)

Go away (alright, click me, click me here)

Go away (click on me, alright)

Go away

Go away

Go away

  (You no good dirty son of a bitch, sneaking peeks at my pussy)

(You no good dirty son of a bitch)

[Move! Get outta the way!]

I am your love
I am your hate
All this and more
For me and my whore

Make me lie down
And beg like a dog
Whip my behind
If I should do wrong

(Oh, you bastard)
(O-oh, you bastard)

Follow me ’round
Until I get lost
Then pull back my chain
And show me who’s boss

Don’t be afraid
No need for this shit
You’re my private nurse
This won’t hurt a bit

Pull back my skin
And stick me with pins
Move closer to me

(Oh, you bastard)
(You dirty bastard, did you think I’ll ever let you touch me there?)

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won’t shout

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won’t shout!

I swear I won’t shout
I won’t shout!

What a trip!

(Oh, you bastard)
(You dirty bastard, did you think I’ll ever let you touch me there?)

(You’ve been sneaking peeks at my pussy, I won’t see your cock any fucking second, you bitch)
(What is this, ah? What is this with your little thing?)
(I’ll show you the first class hots for being an inobedient bitch)

(Oh, you bastard)
(Oh, you bastard)
(Oh, you bastard)

(You no good dirty son of a bitch!)

[Move! Get outta the way!]

(You think you know that man)
(You really don’t)

  I’ve been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How’d I get so faded?
How’d I get so faded?

Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You’d never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

I’ve been looking for a lover
Thought I’d find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I’ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you loved me how
You’d never learn
Ooh
Coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in

All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line…

Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken-hearted

  Like the legend of the phoenix, huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning, uh huh
The force from the beginning, huh, look

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it, uh huh

We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get

We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get

We're up all night to get together
We're up all night to get (Oh, we might get funked again)
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

(We're up all night to get lucky) We've come too far
(We're up all night to get lucky) To give up
(We're up all night to get lucky) Who we are
(We're up all night to get lucky) So let's
(We're up all night to get lucky) Raise the bar
(We're up all night to get lucky) And our cups

She's up all night 'til the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
